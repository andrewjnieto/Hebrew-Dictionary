# Hebrew Dictionary

## andrewjnieto.com/hebrew

Repository for open source compilation of a variety of biblical hebrew resources for a complete dictionary of biblical hebrew words and their occurence within the Tanakh building upon the work of Strong's Concordance, open source definitions, and mappings.

### Respository Map
