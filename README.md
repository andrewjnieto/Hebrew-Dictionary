## Background

Hebrew-Dictionary is a project I have been working on and thinking about since I was a freshman computer science student. At the very beginning, I had no Idea how I was going to be able to do such a thing, but now as a senior, I recognize and know of the countless ways something as mundane as a simple biblical Hebrew dictionary can be done. This project is by no means a crowning achievement or a masterpiece, but is a simple reminder of the many ways I have grown to use many types of technologies and languages to work on a project.

There are many things I would do differently now that I know more, but I am nonetheless satisfied of where this project is so far and look forward to updating it incrementally in the future.
