Noah's flood that submerged the entire planet earth under water for about a year
++++
Some think Noah's flood was only local. However the description of it found in Gen. 6 through 8 makes this patently absurd. If it was local, Noah had 120 years to migrate out of the area to safe ground! Why waste all that effort building a ship? He only had to move less than 1500 feet a day to reach the farthest point on the globe! With the possible exception of Ps 29:10,  this word always refers to Noah's flood. The real reason for insisting on a local flood is the acceptance of evolution with its long geological ages. Most holding that view are not willing to allow a global world wide flood to have happened less than 5000 years ago. To admit such eliminates the need for the geological ages for most of the geological column would have been rapidly laid down by Noah's flood.

When the female of the scarlet worm species was ready to give birth to her young,  she would attach her body to the trunk of a tree,  fixing herself so firmly and permanently that she would never leave again. The eggs deposited beneath her body were thus protected until the larvae were hatched and able to enter their own life cycle. As the mother died,  the crimson fluid stained her body and the surrounding wood. From the dead bodies of such female scarlet worms,  the commercial scarlet dyes of antiquity were extracted. What a picture this gives of Christ,  dying on the tree, shedding His precious blood that He might "bring many sons unto glory" (Heb 2:10)! He died for us,  that we might live through him! Ps 22:6 describes such a worm and gives us this picture of Christ. (cf. Isa 1:18) (from page 73, "Biblical Basis for Modern Science",  1985, Baker Book House,  by Henry Morris)
